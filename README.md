# WME Road Width Helper (WRWH)
Script for the Waze Map Editor (WME) which sets shortcuts for quickly updating road width data.

## Instructions
1. Select one or more segments.
2. Use one of the keyboard shortcuts to change the segments' lane width.

The first time you use a shortcut, a preference panel appears on the WME. There you can set a value for the lane width to be used every time a shortcut gets pressed.

## Default Shortcuts
* 1 to 9 (by default, *not* from the NumPad): set the selected segments as *x* lanes width.
* 0 (by default, *not* from the NumPad): remove all **width-related** lanes information from the selected segments.
* \+ increase the lanes width (by default, *not* from the NumPad)
* \- decrease the lanes width (by default, *not* from the NumPad)

You may change all shortcuts in the WME's key shortcuts panel on the bottom right.
